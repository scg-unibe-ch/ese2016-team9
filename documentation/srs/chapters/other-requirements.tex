\subsection{Performance Requirements}
	?? \\
	The system should, given a reasonable connection to the internet, be
	able to search and find results in a fluent manner, e.g. in at most a

	user requirements, due to the non-dynamic way of loading pages out of a
	database.

\subsection{Security Requirements}
