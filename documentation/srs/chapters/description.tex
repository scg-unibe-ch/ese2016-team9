\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
	Flatfindr is a self-contained product that has no connections to other software.	

\subsection{Product Functions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Creating / viewing ads for flats and flats
	\item Linking housemates to ads
	\item General search functionality with specific criteria
	\item Scheduling visits
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
	\subsubsection{User}
		The general user has two main roles which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. These are: \\
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item 		Advertiser: A user can place an ad (for free) on the homepage, which is then publicly visible.
		\item		Client: A client can look through the ads put up by advertisers and can contact the advertisers via the message functionality.
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\subsubsection{Premium User}
		By paying a fee for additional features, the premium user strongly increases the resources 
		of the programming team. If the premium features are beneficial to the general user, the 
		quantity of premium users will be optimal.
		
\subsection{Operating Environment}
	Flatfindr runs on any frequently used browser, i.e. Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer.
	
\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
	The template of Flatfindr was delivered using Java, MySQL, Hibernation and JavaScript. Changing this would 
	present unnecessary additional effort, which is why, in this way, we are constrained by these frameworks and languages.\\
	The software should be maintainable, so object-oriented design will be best-practice.
	Other than that, there seem to be no requirements, especially security.
